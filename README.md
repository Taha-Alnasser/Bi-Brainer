# Bi-Brainer
A dual algorithm that utilizes Minimax with alpha-beta pruning and MCTS by switching dynamically at the point of a threshold during the game. The algorithm is then compared to individual tests of Minimax and MCTS in Gomoku.

Instructions on running:
1. Ensure you have aima-python installed as well as regular python libraries such as random.
2. Choose the number of iterations from the main in n_iter, the more iterations, the longer it will take to run
3. Test it out!
